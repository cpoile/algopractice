# Algorithms Practice

A place to practice. I will try to keep this in idiomatic Golang.

Books include:
* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) (under gobook)
* [Algorithms (4th Edition) by Sedgewick and Wayne](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X) (under sedgewick)

Sites include:
* [Exercism Go track](https://exercism.io/tracks/go) (under exercism)

I'd be happy to help others or work through problems along with someone else. Drop me a line if you're interested.

Thanks for taking a look.
